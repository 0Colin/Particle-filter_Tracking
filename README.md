# Particle filter_Tracking
Based on the particle filter algorithm, real-time tracking of single targets is realized on video images and real-time lenses.

## Requirements
MATLAB

## Usage

This demo tries to identify the location of the red object in a movie.

To run this demo, just run the script "particle_filter_by_saved_movie.m".

To run the real-time demo "particle_filter_by_usb_camera.m", you need a web camera and Image Acquitision Toolbox.
